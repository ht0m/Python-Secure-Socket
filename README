Goal:
This is a small chat/server chat system.(Work in progress, as it is more on educational purposess)
Goals
1. Obtain real time chat with multiple threads.
2. Encrypt data 

Update 01/20/2014:
As of more researching I have decided it is probably best to redo the code from ground up otherwise it can become
unstable. As of now the old code will remain untill a stable basic client/server chat ststem is complete.
